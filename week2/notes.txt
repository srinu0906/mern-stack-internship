>>> Quokkka extension 
- It is like a playground for javascript

>>> Variable are like containers
- let keyword is used to define variables

- 3 varaible declarations
i.var        ii.let       iii.const

- var was used previously before 2015(ES6)
- problem is value can be reassigned in var declarations
- so 'let' and 'const' were introduced
-'let is similar to 'var' , but 'const' is fixed (constant)

>>> Datatypes
- number, string, boolean
- two types of Datatypes
    1. Primitive :- basic (number,string, boolean,undefined)
    2. Non-primitive :- they hold large and complex values(functions,arrays,objects)

>>> Arrays
- used to store collection of items of any datatype 
- Array methods
// to add elementa from the last -> push()
// to remove eleement at last place -> pop()
//add elements from start -> unshift()
//remove elements from start -> shift()
